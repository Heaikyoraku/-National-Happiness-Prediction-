# Predicting National Happiness with Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of a machine learning course in my Artificial Intelligence major. It aims to analyze and predict the happiness score of nations using socio-economic indicators from the World Happiness Report.

##  Project Summary

We explore how factors like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and freedom of choice impact national happiness. Two regression models were used to understand and predict these influences:

- **Linear Regression**: Used as a baseline due to its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Used for its ability to model complex, non-linear relationships.
